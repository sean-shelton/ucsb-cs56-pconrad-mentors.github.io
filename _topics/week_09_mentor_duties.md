The following is a very rough "top of head" brain dump of a thread from Slack on what mentors were being asked to do during the week 9 lab in F17.

Later on, we might clean this up into a more coherent guide to what needs to be done.

Hi Everyone: today in lab, all mentors should focus on having at least 10 minutes with each of their pairs, 
preferably more like 20 (when time allows), to go over all of their pull requests. 

HAVE THE STUDENTS DEMO AND WALK YOU THROUGH THEIR CODE for each of the issues that they resolved.    
Make comments on the issues if there is anything you see that causes concern.

Then... as soon as possibly after lab (or even better, during lab if time permits) 
fill out the FEEDBACK_ repos for each of your pairs, including the material from 
https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad-mentors.github.io/topics/legacy_code_projects_giving_feedback/

If all has gone well, by now, you are done with that for the lab05 feedback, 
and all that needs to be done is to add the lab07 feedback.    
If you haven't done the lab05 feedback yet.

tl;dr student work on Legacy Code Projects should already be DONE, FINISHED, COMPLETE 
at this point, 
and what needs to be done asap is the code review by you. the mentors, 
in preparation for the TAs assigning final points.

I'll add some column to the spreadsheet where mentors can mark when they've finished the lab05 review, and the lab07 review.
